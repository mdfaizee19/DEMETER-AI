**Verifiable Quality Certification for Agricultural Trade**

AgriQCert is a high-complexity, web-based platform that digitizes and secures agricultural export and import certification using **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. It replaces fragmented, paper-heavy compliance workflows with a **tamper-proof, AI-assisted, blockchain-backed system** aligned with **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **OpenID4VP** standards.

The platform enables farmers, QA agencies, DPP issuers, exporters, importers, and consumers to **issue, carry, and verify trusted quality certificates** (Digital Product Passports) using **DID-based identities** and **QR-based instant verification**.

---

## 🚀 Why AgriQCert Exists
Agricultural trade suffers from:
- Manual document verification (slow, error-prone)
- Fraud via forged lab reports and certificates
- Illegible scans, PDFs, and inconsistent formats
- Lack of real-time trust for importers and customs

**AgriQCert solves this by design.**  
It ensures that **what is verified is exactly what was issued**, cryptographically and transparently.

---

## 🧠 Core Innovations
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** as Digital Product Passports (DPPs)
- **DID-based trust model** for issuers and verifiers
- **Blockchain anchoring** for tamper resistance
- **AI-powered document extraction** from fuzzy scans and PDFs
- **QR-based instant verification** via Inji Verify
- **End-to-end auditability** across farmer → QA → DPP issuer → exporter → importer → consumer

## 🏗️ System Overview
| Actor       | Role |
|-------------|------|
| **Farmer**  | Harvests and records crop details, provides samples for QA |
| **QA Certifier** | Conducts quality checks, uploads results, requests verifiables |
| **DPP Issuer** | Creates and issues Verifiable Credentials (DPPs) |
| **Exporter** | Exports with DPP metadata, shares DPPs |
| **Importer** | Verifies DPP via Inji, checks authenticity and data |
| **Consumer** | Optionally scans QR to view DPP data |

---

## 🔄 Architecture & Workflow
The workflow follows a secure, step-by-step process from harvest to consumption, ensuring traceability and trust at every stage. This linear design minimizes friction, reduces attack surfaces, and scales to high-volume trade.

**Verifiable Quality Certification for Agricultural Trade**

AgriQCert is a high-complexity, web-based platform that digitizes and secures agricultural export and import certification using **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. It replaces fragmented, paper-heavy compliance workflows with a **tamper-proof, AI-assisted, blockchain-backed system** aligned with **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **OpenID4VP** standards.

The platform enables exporters, QA agencies, and importers/customs authorities to **issue, carry, and verify trusted quality certificates** (Digital Product Passports) using **DID-based identities** and **QR-based instant verification**.

## 🧠 In-Depth Architecture Explanation

This sequence architecture represents a **trust-minimized, forward-only pipeline** tailored for agricultural supply chains. It mirrors real-world logistics while enforcing cryptographic compliance at every stage.

### 1. Farmer Submission (F → Q)

The farmer initiates the workflow by submitting core provenance metadata:
- Crop type (e.g., organic coffee)
- GPS location
- Harvest timestamp

This establishes trust at origin and prevents fraud early.

**Why forward-only?**  
Agricultural flows are inherently linear (field → ship → shelf). Corrections happen via audits, not real-time backtracking.

---

### 2. QA Request & Sample Exchange (Q ↔ F, Q → Q)

- QA requests physical/digital samples (soil tests, images)
- Farmer provides samples
- QA conducts lab/field tests:
  - Moisture content
  - Pesticide residues (spectrometry)

AI assists by:
- Extracting data from fuzzy scans/PDFs
- Flagging anomalies (e.g., mismatched weights or dates)

Human oversight ensures regulatory compliance (e.g., EU residue limits).

Minimal bidirectional exchange ensures speed and efficiency.

---

### 3. Digital Product Passport (DPP) Issuance (Q → D, D → D)

QA uploads verified results to a **neutral DPP Issuer**, which:
- Generates a W3C-compliant Verifiable Credential
- Signs it using issuer DID
- Anchors a cryptographic hash on-chain (Ethereum / Polygon)

**Why a separate issuer?**  
Separates scientific validation (QA) from cryptographic trust (issuer), improving neutrality and auditability.

---

### 4. Export Sharing (D → E, E → I)

- Exporter receives the DPP as a secure QR / link
- Goods are shipped with QR attached to packaging and documents
- No direct Farmer → Exporter path to prevent bypassing QA

The QR acts as a **digital twin**, linking physical goods to verifiable credentials.

---

### 5. Importer Verification (E → I, I → V, V → I)

At border or port:
- Importer scans QR using **Inji Verify**
- System validates:
  - Issuer DID authenticity
  - VC signature integrity
  - Expiry & revocation status
  - Compliance thresholds (e.g., pesticide limits)

Blockchain anchoring ensures tamper detection.

**This is the trust pivot.**  
Failure immediately halts import.  
Latency is <2 seconds via edge caching.

---

### 6. Consumer Access (Optional) (I → C, C → V → C)

Post-import:
- Consumers may scan QR for transparency (farm-to-table proof)
- Optional by design to keep system B2B-first while enabling B2C trust

---

## 🧩 Design Principles

- **Linearity** – Mirrors physical logistics
- **Minimal Connections** – Only essential interactions (12 total)
- **Tamper-Proofing** – Each step builds on cryptographic proofs
- **Scalability** – 1M+ certificates/year, offline-capable QR scans
- **Fail-Fast** – QA failure aborts workflow early
- **Auditability** – Full replay via logs

This architecture doubles as **executable pseudocode** for backend orchestration.
